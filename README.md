# EAEE4000-Project

Apologies in advance if the codes are a little bit unorganized and hard to read. I think I commented most bits but some may have escaped me. Most of the notebooks should also be cleaned and the scratch and troubleshooting bits deleted.

So firstly, the data. The data for the New York offshore wind ones came from this website: https://oswbuoysny.resourcepanorama.dnv.com/download/f67d14ad-07ab-4652-16d2-08d71f257da1. And for the Texas onshore wind one it came from this site: https://zenodo.org/records/5516539

I had some issue psuhing some files to github, I speculate that it is due to the files being too large to commit but I'm still working on it. If this is not resolved, the files I had trouble upload are uploaded to google drive. They are just the dataset and the model, all the scripts are in the repo. The data can be access using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CaUJVO1U4P5UanDGSt9GmGqI_w4ecCjE?usp=drive_link and the models using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UF0IU43HFKvrHXFd4S1Rd8iHwIu4IIQ0?usp=drive_link

The data are found in the folder named Data. The notebooks in the model folder are the definitive notebooks that are used to show the result in the report. Mostly the results came from the third model, which are named LSTM_definitive. The notebook named graph was used to generate the first distribution plot shown in the report. And the recursive and GAN are for the two "not so successful" models. There is one that has one month as input and one that has two month. There is also a draft folder where some ideas or debugging took place, but are not representative of the project.

The model and the tuner folders saved their respective files. 

If there are any questions, please let me know at jx2543@columbia.edu and I can explain it. 

Thank you and happy holidays.
